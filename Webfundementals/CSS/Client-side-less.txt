Client-side Usage

Client-side is the easiest way to get started and good for developing with LESS, but in production, when performance and reliability are important, we recommend pre-compiling using node.js or one of the many third-party tools available (you'll learn later in the bootcamp how to pre-compile LESS/SASS using Node.js or Rails).

To start off, link your   .less stylesheets with the rel attribute set to "stylesheet/less":

<link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="styles.less" />
Next,  download less.js and include it in a <script></script> tag in the <head> element of your page:

<script src="less.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
Or the CDN, here:

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/less.js/2.5.1/less.min.js"></script>
