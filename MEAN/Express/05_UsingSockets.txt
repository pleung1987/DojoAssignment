Adding sockets to Express
* To add socket functionality to any Express project...
1) Add the socket.io module
2) Modify the server-side code
3) Modify the client-side code

* Node module we will be using for this is called 'socket.io'

- So our first step is to install socket.io.
* Since socket.io is just a node module we already know how to install it using npm install.
* (I hope you guys are seeing a theme with npm install here)

                    npm install socket.io --save

-> Check out Sockets folder server.js to see how to create socket functions

Configuring the client:
* Let's assume the app we're going to build is a single-page application,
    -> so we only need to serve one view
    -> which will be served by the root route (app.get('/')...etc )

* On the client, we emitted an event using socket.emit().
    -> The first parameter we passed to that method was a string
    -> This is the name of the event that will be emitted!!
    -> The second parameter we passed to the method is a JSON object.
* The socket connection allows us to pass JSON objects back and forth between client and server.
ie.
    -> in the callback of our "button_clicked" method, we added the line:

        socket.emit('server_response', {response: "sockets are the best!"})

* This is an example of emitting an event from the server to the client.
* The convention is very similar to the technique we just saw:
    -> we emit an event and pass a JSON object.

Server-side emit syntax:
