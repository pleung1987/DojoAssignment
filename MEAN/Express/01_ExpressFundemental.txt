Express
* Express is just a set of tools built on top of Node.js that allow us to more easily handle
    requests and build a robust server.

* Unlike other MVC frameworks (like Codeigniter, Django, and Rails), Express is quite flexible in the
    way it can be configured.

Fundamental knowledge for Express:
* Client-Server Model
* The Traditional HTTP request/response cycle
* What is Node.js?
    -> What does "require" do?
    -> What is module.exports?
    -> What are Node modules (middleware)?

MVC ~
* Same as Python ` Model`,`View`, `Controller`

What is Express?
* Express.js is a framework built in JavaScript using Node.js as the server component.
    ->  Express isn't exclusively MVC.
    -> It's actually more so just a set of tools that allows us to create a more robust Node Server.

* After we created the server.js file and call onto the app to do its stuff...:
    -> Install Express (Node Module) with npm
        -> in terminal: npm install express
        -> your file should contain a node_module folder after the installation.

The node_modules folder ~
* node_modules folder is the folder that "npm install" installs your dependencies in.
* All Node applications have 3rd party modules that they may use.
* To use these, you must run "npm install package_name" which will then install the module and all of
    its dependencies inside of the node_modules folder.

* After you done installing node_modules folder -> run the node server.js
