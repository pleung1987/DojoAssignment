Bind, Call, and Apply~
* these three methods can take your code to the next level.

* when we call new Constructor(); a few things happen:
    - A new instance of Constructor is created that inherits from object.
    - The new instance is linked with the Constructor.prototype.
    - this is bound to the newly constructed instance.
    - the object is returned.

NOTE: Bind, Call, and Apply allow us to regulate this.

1) Create an index.html file and include a main.js file.
2) Bower install jQuery, and include jquery before the main.js file.
3) Add a button to the HTML body.

* Bind also takes an optional argument

* Bind is a fantastic tool to control which 'this' we are using and pass information from object to object,
  or use other objects methods and will help DRY out your code.

** WARNING: BIND CREATES A NEW METHOD OR OVERWRITES A METHOD IN THE OBJECT **

Call and Apply

* First: think of Commas when you hear Call, and Arrays when you hear Apply.
    -> Call and Apply allow us to inherit methods from other constructors:

        function Ninja(name, age){
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
          // there could be lots of other stuff here!
        }
        function BlackBelt(name,age){
          //Commas!
          Ninja.call(this,name,age);
          this.belt = 'black';
        }
        function YellowBelt(name,age){
          //ARRAY
          Ninja.apply(this,[name,age]);
          this.belt = 'yellow';
        }
        var yB = new YellowBelt('mike', 40);
        var bB = new BlackBelt('charlie', 29);
        console.log(bB.name);
        console.log(yB.name);
        Copy
