Friends API~
* We are going to work in 3 files that we previously created: server.js, routes.js, and mongoose.js;

* We create 2 more folders if we don’t already have them:
    - models
        -> In models, we are going to put a friend.js file.
    - controllers
        -> In controllers, we are going to put a friends.js file.

* We provide a quick update to server.js, full code for mongoose.js (minus the DB name which you will have to provide)
    ->  And most of the code for the routes.js (minus a require of the controllers/friends.js file).
    -> We provide a template for the controllers/friends.js file but the methods need to be fleshed out.
    -> We provide a very barebone models/friend.js file, which will also need to be filled out.

Let’s start with server.js:
    -> We’ve already required routes.js and routes.js exports an empty function with a parameter app.
    -  Let’s pass our server app into that function as an argument:



Tips to Start a project:
    1) Install Dependencies
    2) setup server.js and server folder
    3) Make a client folder
    4) Make a static folder
        -> boiler plate: see if the index.html shows up (seeing hello world)
    5) Set up database
        -> put sample data into mongoose
        -> console.log a fetching
    6) Set up routing for partials
