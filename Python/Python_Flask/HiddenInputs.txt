Hidden Inputs
- Hidden input fields are form fields that are hidden from the user.
- Used to transfer information between different pages.
- No visual representation in the rendered HTML, but the form element IS usable by the method where the form is sent.

In HTML:
            <input type="hidden" name="action" value="register">

Say in Form:
    Form 1:
            <form method="post" action="/process">
                <input type="hidden" name="action" value="register">
                <input type="text" name="first_name">
                <input type="text" name="last_name">
                <input type="text" name="email">
                <input type="password" name="password">
                <input type="submit" value="Register">
            </form>
    Form 2:
            <form method="post" action="/process">
                <input type="hidden" name="action" value="login">
                <input type="text" name="email">
                <input type="password" name="password">
                <input type="submit" value="Login">
            </form>

- Set difference with 'Action'
  In the POST /process route, make sure that you have an if statement that checks what form is being submitted:
            if request.form['action'] == 'register':
                                                        //do registration process
            elif request.form['action'] == 'login':
                                                        //do login process

Important Notes:
* By using the hidden input fields we set up on the index page, we can be sure that only the codes
  related to the form being submitted are going to be executed.
* Even though hidden inputs are invisible to the user, it is actually very visible in the page's source
* So be very careful in choosing what data you store in there as value, and set appropriate actions
 if a user tries to change or remove it.
