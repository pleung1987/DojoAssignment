Templates  and Static Files Review:

Here's a review of all the steps and corresponding folders and files involved:

1) Create the Django project Foldeer
2) create the apps directory
3) create the 'dunder' file "__init__.py"
4) create the Django App -> called first_app
5) create the route file in the Django App(first_app) name it urls.py
6) create the view file in the Django APP(first_app) name it views.py
7) create the "View/Templates directories and files"-> templates -> Django App(first_app) -> index.html and ->show_users.html(depending on what is in your index)

* the directory main (same level as your manage.py) contains your settings.py file which must be updated to include your app!

* In our views file, Django knows to look in the templates folder first for whatever path we pass to our render method:

                # views.py
                ...
                def index(request):
                    return render(request, "ourApp/index.html")

* The behavior for static files is very similar: Django’s template rendering system knows (if it's told)
    to look in the static and then at the path for the specific file relative to that folder!

What this looks like in HTML is:

      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title></title>
            {% load staticfiles %}
                                                              # how to connect your css to Django project
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'ourApp/css/main.css' %}"media="screen" title="no title"  charset="utf-8">
          </head>
        <body>
        </body>
      </html>

* In other words, loading static files, whether it's CSS or JavaScript or an image will start the search path inside
    of our app’s static folder, and after that, the rest of that path is up to us!

*  A good habit to get into is separating our JavaScript, CSS, and images into three folders
    (and specifying which app we are retrieving these files from, as outlined in the structure at the top of this tab!


Load images and JS into Django:

Now, all we need to do to access static files (in this case, main.js and styles.css from template file index.html is to add the following to index.html:

  <!-- Inside apps/first_app/templates/first_app/index.html -->
  {% load staticfiles %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'first_app/css/styles.css' %}">
  <script src="{% static 'first_app/js/main.js' %}" > </script>
