SQL (Basics)
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- language designed for managing data in relational databases
- can SELECT data, SELECT data WHERE some conditions are true, INSERT data, UPDATE data, DELETE data, and JOIN different tables together.
-  learning a domain-specific language, unrelated to languages you may have previously seen.
- We will use MAMP (or WAMP) along with MySQL Workbench to interact with our database

MAMP plays an important role by setting up two different servers:
    - the web server (called Apache)
    - database server (running MySQL Server)

Importing Data:
- There are two main ways to import data into your MySQL Workbench. If you have an SQL file, you can just copy and
    paste the commands into the editor and click run.
- If you have an ERD diagram, you can forward engineer into MySQL workbench.

Commands:
- users :
            SELECT *
            FROM users;
- faves :
            SELECT *
            FROM faves;
- follows:
            SELECT *
            FROM follows;
- tweets:
            SELECT *
            FROM tweets;

What query would you run to only get the first names of all of the users?
            SELECT first_name
            FROM users;

What query would you run to only get the first and last names of all of the users?
            SELECT first_name, last_name
            FROM users;

SELECT w/ Conditionals~

What query would you run to only get the first name of users with id of 2?
            SELECT first_name
            FROM users
            WHERE id = 2;

What query would you run to get the last names of users with id of 2 or 3?
            SELECT last_name
            FROM users
            WHERE id = 2 OR id = 3;
What query would you run to get all of the users with id greater than 2?
            SELECT *
            FROM users
            WHERE id > 2;

What query would you run to get all of the users with id less than or equal to 3?
            SELECT *
            FROM users
            WHERE id <= 3;

What query would you run to get all of the users with first names ending in "e"?
            SELECT *
            FROM users
            WHERE first_name LIKE "%e";

What query would you run to get all of the users with first names starting in "K"?
            SELECT *
            FROM users
            WHERE first_name LIKE "K%"

SELECT w/ Sorting
What query would you run to get all of the users with the youngest users at the top of the table?
            SELECT *
            FROM users
            ORDER BY birthday DESC;

What query would you run to get all of the users with the oldest users at the top of the table?
            SELECT *
            FROM users
            ORDER BY birthday ASC;

What query would you run to get all of the users with the first name that ends with "e" with the youngest users at the top of the table?
            SELECT *
            FROM users
            WHERE first_name LIKE "%e"
            ORDER BY birthday DESC;

What query would you run to get only the first names of all of the users in alphabetical order?
            SELECT first_name
            FROM users
            ORDER BY first_name;
