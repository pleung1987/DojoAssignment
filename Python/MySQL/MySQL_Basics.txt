Why MySQL and Database Design?
- Databases are merely collections of organized information that can easily be accessed, managed, and updated.
- As a full-stack developer, you need to be familiar with building your database and designing the rules by which it stores data!
* most important things about database design is organizing your data to minimize repetition.

Relational database models and different ways to relate data using them:
ERD: short for 'Entity Relationship Diagram'.
    - are essentially visual blueprints for how your database looks and behaves.
    - ERDs and SQL work together very intimately.
    - An ERD is a map of the structure of how we want to store our data

SQL: SQL is the language we use to manipulate the data as per the relationships we defined in our ERD.

Why ERD?
    - ERD is a process of laying out your tables and establishing relationships between them, making your data relational.
    -there is rational and non-rational database"
        - non-relational databases where everything is stored in a single table.

Main Topics for Database Design
    * one very simple concept: Don't Repeat Data
    Terminologies to remember:
        - Database Relationships
            One to One
            One to Many
            Many to Many
        - Three (3) Forms of Normalization
        - MySQL Workbench
        - Data Types

     - When we normalize our tables, we don't repeat data. =>  we can use our storage space more efficiently.
     - Using SQL, we can manipulate our tables and create the customized table that we need for the job at hand.
     - This means that we can create our own customized tables depending on the task at hand using SQL.

One to One Relationships
    - Consider the following table customers:
        - Although each customer can only have one address, it would seem more fitting and better
        organized if we separate out the address and put it in its own table
        - Since each address that we have can only belong to a single customer and each customer can only have one address,
         we call this a [One to One Relationship.]
        - Even though we split up our tables into two different tables, we can combine them into one using SQL.
    Examples of One-to-One:
        * Customers and Credit Cards - Every Customer has one Credit Card, every Credit Card belongs to one Customer.
        * User and Email - Every User has one Email Address, every Email Address has one User.
        * Product and Image - Every Product has an Image, every Image is of a Product.

One to Many Relationships
    - occurs most often.
    - Example of one customer with multiple orders:
        -Since one customer can have many orders for any given user we call this a One to Many Relationship.
    - Notice how the foreign key and the id of the table that we want to combine act as the glue.

    Example of one to many:
        * Messages and Comments - One Comment belongs to one Message, but one Message can have many Comments.
        * States and Cities - One City is only in one State, but one State can have many Cities.
        * Customers and Orders - One Order only has one Customer, but one Customer can have many Orders.

Many to Many Relationships
    - We have a table that keeps track of each of the orders the customer placed but we haven't
      created a way to keep track of the items they are ordering.
    - Since each order can have many different items and those same items can show up in many different orders,
      we have to use a different type of relationship to connect orders to items.
    - Orders can have many items and items can have many orders.
    - In a Many to Many relationship, we create a connector table that has both the order_id and the item_id
      so that we can determine all the items in a particular order.

* anytime you have a Many-to-Many, it will require some sort of joining table!
Examples:
    * Users and Interests - One User can have many Interests, one Interest can be applied to many Users.
    * Actresses and Movies - One Movie can have many Actresses, one Actress can be in many Movies.
    * Businesses and Cities - One Business can be spread across many Cities, one City can be home to many Businesses.

Normalization
- Database normalization is simply a convention for splitting large tables of data into smaller separate tables
  with the primary goal being to not repeat data.

Example:
    * If we want to store a user's email address, we'd want to store it in only one place.
      Then, if we ever need to refer to it again, we'd simply use the id.
    * id will never change, so even if we update the user's email address, none of the other connections we defined in our database will be damaged.

Below are the three main rules of database normalization:
First Form~
        Each Column in your table can only have 1 value.
Second Form~
        Each Column in your table that is not a key (primary or foreign) must have unique values.
        ie. If you have a movies table with a categories column, you should not have a category repeated more than once.
Third Form~
        You cannot have a non-key column that is dependent on another non-key column.
        ie. If you have a books table with columns publisher_name and publisher_address, the publisher_address and
        publisher_name should be separated into a separate table and linked to books with a foreign key.

SELECT w/ Sorting

Descending order:

SELECT *SELECT name, language, percentage
FROM countries, languages
WHERE countries.id= languages.country_id AND languages.language = "Slovene";

FROM users
ORDER BY birthday DESC;

Order by asscending

SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY birthday ASC;
