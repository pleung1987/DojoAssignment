MySQL Communication ~

* Creating our sample application using given friendsdb sample:

/friends/server.py :

                from flask import Flask, request, redirect, render_template, session, flash
                from mysqlconnection import MySQLConnector
                app = Flask(__name__)
                mysql = MySQLConnector(app,'friendsdb')
                @app.route('/')
                def index():
                    return render_template('index.html')
                @app.route('/friends', methods=['POST'])
                def create():
                    # add a friend to the database!
                    return redirect('/')
                app.run(debug=True)
                Copy

Inserting Data into Queries
Now, if we wanted a route to fetch a specific user we would have to modify the query of fetching all the users slightly:

                @app.route('/friends/<friend_id>')
                def show(friend_id):
                    # Write query to select specific user by id. At every point where
                    # we want to insert data, we write ":" and variable name.
                    query = "SELECT * FROM friends WHERE id = :specific_id"
                    # Then define a dictionary with key that matches :variable_name in query.
                    data = {'specific_id': friend_id}
                    # Run query with inserted data.
                    friends = mysql.query_db(query, data)
                    # Friends should be a list with a single object,
                    # so we pass the value at [0] to our template under alias one_friend.
                    return render_template('index.html', one_friend=friends[0])

Notice how we are grabbing the friend_id from the URL and passing that into the function as the same name as the URL parameter, friend_id.
