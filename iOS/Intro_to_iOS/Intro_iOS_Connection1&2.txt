Connections I
* finished building our UI and properly laid it out using Auto Layout...
    -> we can start thinking about the implementation of the app

Outlets
-> two Outlets:
    1) an Outlet for the question label
    2) the answer label
    *  We want to be able to change the text inside of these labels in our application
    ie. If the user clicks next, we want to display the text of the next question
        -> Do this by control dragging from the storyboard to the View Controller.

* Now that the labels are wired up, we can change its value in our code.
    -> labels have a property called text that we can change.
    -> viewDidLoad() method gets called automatically once our view has loaded
        ->  Good place to do some set-up code.
        -> Once this message is sent to our View Controller, we will change the text properties
        of the labels which will result in our application displaying the correct question and answer.

Connections II
* Setting up an Outlet is connecting a property from code to a View object on the Storyboard
* Setting up an Action is connecting a method from code to an event that a user can trigger by
    interacting with one or more View objects.

Actions
* For Buttons:
    -> Once the user touches the button and releases the finger within the bounds of the button,
    we want to trigger some lines of code.
        ie.  when the Answer button is clicked, we might want to to display our Answer label
    -> View object that is going to trigger this event is going to be a UIButton.
    -> Any is too vague: We want to explicitly state that a UIButton is going to trigger this event.
    ->  Then when this code is triggered, the sender object will be passed into the block of code which
        would be the UIButton that alerted the View Controller about an event.

-> Specify the Type to be UIButton only because this describes our IBAction a little better.
* This action is going to get triggered by a UIButton.
->  Once the method gets called:
    -> it passes a sender argument which is the View object that triggered this action
    ->  We can leave it at AnyObject and our code will still work but it is good practice
    to be more descriptive when we can.
-> Can write the lines of code that we want to execute when someone clicks inside our different buttons:
* We will just log out that a particular button was pressed for now. We will be able to see the results
of the log in our Debug Area of our Xcode.
